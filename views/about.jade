                |A nexus, a cybernetic third place, an anachronistic death dream from deep inside the bygone blogosphere, 
                |D–S–L–R is a multimedia art and culture publication rendered as nonlinear webart hyperlink maze. 
                |D–S–L–R is a love letter to the Web1.0 queer internet, braced against 30 years of aesthetic cacophony and abstraction. 
                |The prototype showcase, inspired by Barbara Hammer’s 1987 sex-text No No Nooky T.V.; 
                |is an aphrodisiac assemblage: an ever-shifting interactive digital gallery installation that can be seen, played with, and expanded into meatspace. 
                |The traveling D–S–L–R installation will exhibit submissions as photo booth filter fodder, spliced into frames, stamps, stickers, and missives. 
                |<br>The kiss cam is live. Submissions are open. D–S–L–R is presented courtesy of Futsch Entertainment.
